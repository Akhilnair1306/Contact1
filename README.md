Contact Management Application
Description
This is a contact management web application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and view contact information. It features a user-friendly interface built with React, and the backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The app provides functionalities like form validation, sorting contacts alphabetically, and managing contact information, including first name, last name, email, phone number, job title, and company name.

Features
Create Contact: Add new contacts to the database with information such as name, email, phone number, and job title.
Edit Contact: Update existing contact information.
Delete Contact: Remove contacts from the database.
Sort Contacts: View contacts sorted alphabetically by first name.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Material UI
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
Form Validation: Regular expressions for validating email and phone numbers.
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v12 or above)
MongoDB (or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
Frontend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/new-repository-name.git
cd new-repository-name
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Run the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React application on http://localhost:3000.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Setup environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder and add the following:
bash
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/contactdb
PORT=5000
Run the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Database Schema
In MongoDB, we store contact information using a Contact schema.

js
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const contactSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  fname: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  lname: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    validate: {
      validator: (value) => {
        const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
        return emailRegex.test(value);
      },
      message: 'Please enter a valid email address',
    },
  },
  contactnumber: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    validate: {
      validator: (value) => {
        const phoneRegex = /^[0-9]{10}$/;
        return phoneRegex.test(value);
      },
      message: 'Mobile number must be 10 digits long',
    },
  },
  jobTitle: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  companyName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Contact', contactSchema);
Backend API Endpoints
GET /api/contact: Fetch all contacts
POST /api/contact: Add a new contact
PUT /api/contact/
: Update an existing contact
DELETE /api/contact/
: Delete a contact by ID
Important Technical Decisions
MongoDB for Database: We use MongoDB for easy scalability and flexibility with the contact data. It allows us to store unstructured data (e.g., contacts with varying amounts of information) in a NoSQL format.

React for Frontend: React allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface that is easy to scale and maintain. We also use Reactâ€™s hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage state and handle side effects.

Material UI for Styling: We use Material UI for consistent and modern design components that improve the user experience.

Form Validation: We use regular expressions to validate contact data like phone numbers and emails before submitting the form. This improves data integrity and user experience.

How the App Works
Frontend (React): The frontend sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend API to interact with the contact data. It uses React state to render contact details dynamically.

Backend (Node.js/Express): The backend provides API endpoints for CRUD operations and communicates with MongoDB using Mongoose to store and retrieve contact data.

MongoDB: The database stores the contact information, ensuring that the app is able to persist data even after the app is closed or refreshed.

Troubleshooting
Cannot Connect to MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a service like MongoDB Atlas. Check your .env configuration.

Form Validation Issues: If you are getting errors on the form, ensure that the email and phone number fields match the specified patterns.
